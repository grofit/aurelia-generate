        <p>As you can see it automatically knows how to generate forms for models, and gives contextual ids / labels / placeholders</p>
        <p>You can even write your own generators to apply whatever conventions you want.</p>

        <h2>Generated form from model with custom generator</h2>
        <generate using-model.bind="user" type="super-strike"></generate>
        <p>This stupid generator turns all your properties into striked elements...</p>
